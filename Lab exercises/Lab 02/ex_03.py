"""
In Python, if a class contains two __init__ methods, the last defined __init__ method will override the previous one, and only the last defined method will be executed. Python does not support multiple __init__ methods; instead, the latest definition replaces the earlier ones.

Python does not suport method overloading, so the last defined method will override the previous one.
